    # - Physical size: 56mm×250mm×250mm (FOV too narrow, depth too large)
    # - Issue: Either wrong scan type (localizer instead of diagnostic) or
    #   misoriented axes in NIfTI header
    # - Impact: Fundamentally different from rest of dataset (extreme outlier)
    # - Decision: Exclude to maintain data quality
